# IST 420 Lab 2
In this lab I learned how to create a github account, edit files, add to my repository, create pull requests, and type basic markdowns. Before this lab, I had no experience with github, so it was very interesting to see how it worked and very beneficial to see how it can be used in a business and technology environment that promotes collaboration and communication. I specifically focused on the pull request because it was the most confusing part of the lab for me. Focusing on the hardest part really taught me what it meant and how I can use it in the future. Creating pull requests is very benficial when making changes to a main branch and fixing issues.

I believe that this is something that the field of business should learn more about as it can be beneficial to know what it takes to make changes to code. The content of gitbuh can rane from very technical to very basic and I am excited to explore more of the technical aspects of github in the future. Following the process flow shown in my youtube video really helped me understand the purpose of the pull request and how having one bug with multiple developers finding a solution can actually be very entertaining. As I said, seeing the gap where the business does not know as much about the technology in github is a gap that I would like to fill by teaching others.
